# Raspberry Pi General Purpose Input/Output
I am using this directory to store code for the Raspberry Pi 3B+ that I own wherein I take the GPIO kit and some goodies I bought on Amazon and screw around with circuits.

## Learnings
The maximum recommended draw from one of the 3.3V pins is 50 mA or 0.005 A.

Since 
```
V / I = R
```
So..
```
3.3V / 0.005A = x立
```
Therefore we need at least a resistance of...
```
660立
```
My tests utilized resistors with 1k立 or 1000立, which kept the Raspberry Pi safe.

Pretty cheap @ <$15!
