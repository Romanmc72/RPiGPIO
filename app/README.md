# The RPiGPIO apps
These are applications that I have built and tested which are designed to run on various raspberry pi devices I have installed throughout my home and elsewhere. See the docstring on each of the scripts for information on how to setup and use the app itself. Generally speaking these are meant to be installed and remotely triggered either via another process or some physical event. Read the docs from [RaspberryPi.org](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/usage/gpio/) and remember to have fun and stay safe!

## No Promises
I offer no promises that these will work forever or be actively maintained. I may get bored with this and drop it, the Raspberry Pi Foundation may make backwards incompatible updates to their software/hardware in the future and I might just not upgrade, or any number of things may occur rendering this software obsolete. This code works and it works for me now. If it does not work for you then that is not my problem. I make no promises or guarantees of any kind with this software. You are free to copy it, reference it, steal it and use it in your own projects. I really do not care (althouhg it would be nice if you gave me credit). I will not address any issues raised concerning the code here and I will not accept any pull requests as this is my personal repo for personal use. I have made it public mostly so others can benefit from my learnings.
